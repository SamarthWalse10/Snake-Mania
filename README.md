# Snake-Mania
Classic snake game similar to Nokia snake game    

A simple JavaScript implementation of the classic snake game, inspired by the iconic version found on old Nokia phones. The objective of the game is to control the snake, guiding it to eat food items and grow in length. However, be careful not to let the snake collide with the boundaries of the game area, as it will result in a game over.
## Features

- Real-time score tracking that increases as the snake consumes more food.
